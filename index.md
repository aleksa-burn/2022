# What is AleksaBurn? üî•

AleksaBurn is the whimsical result of an aging individual who has an upcoming 30th birthday and no wedding plans in sight to use as reason to congregate 
her spectacular friends all in one location. You are invited to gather in Latvia to celebrate another year around the sun in the style of my pagan ancestors. 

## Save the Date üéâ

Please block your calendars for **July 29-31 (Friday-Sunday)**. Meeting point in **Riga, Latvia**. 

You are welcome to come earlier and/or stay longer, but these 3 days will include a program of activities, rituals, merrymaking, creative expression, and time to chill.

## Guiding Principles üëØ

These principles are guidelines for how we together can create a magical weekend experience. 

**1. Radical Inclusion:** We welcome and respect unfamiliar faces. If you want to bring a significant other or friend, they are welcome. 

**2. Participation:** Everyone is invited to play. We believe that an incredible weekend experience can occur only through the medium of deeply personal participation. While consent must come first, we welcome active participation in planned events.  

**3. Friendship:** There are good ships and wood ships, ships that sail the sea, but the best ships are friendships, may they always be!

**4. Vaccination:** Please make sure you have your Covid-19 vaccination. Enough said. 

## Travel ‚úàÔ∏è

Riga International Airport (RIX) is located just outside the capital city, and can be easily reached via a number of airline routes that often have layovers in other European countries.
